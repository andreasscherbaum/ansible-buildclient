# ansible-buildclient

Install PostgreSQL and Greenplum Database buildclient with Ansible

## Main usage

That is primarily my own set of instructions how to install my [Buildclient](https://github.com/andreasscherbaum/buildfarm-client). But feel free to look around ...


## Notes

This will install several new roles:

* buildclient (this repository)
* [epel](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-repo-epel)
* [git2](https://github.com/andreasscherbaum/ansible-git2)
* [gpdb5-dev](https://github.com/andreasscherbaum/ansible-gpdb5-dev)
